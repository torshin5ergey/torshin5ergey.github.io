## Description

Conway's [Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life) is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. The simulation consists of a grid of cells, each of which can be in one of two states: alive or dead. At each step of the simulation, cells transition between these states according to certain rules.

## Rules

1. **Survival:** A live cell survives if it has 2 or 3 neighbors (other live cells). Otherwise, it dies due to "loneliness" or "overcrowding".
2. **Birth:** An empty (dead) cell with exactly 3 live neighbors becomes alive.
