## Description
This project implements [Langton's ant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langton's_ant), a cellular automaton devised by Chris Langton in 1986. Langton's ant is a two-dimensional Turing machine with very simple rules but exhibits complex emergent behavior.

## Rules

1. At a **zero** square, turn 90° right, flip the color of the square, move forward one unit.
2. At a **nonzero** square, turn 90° left, flip the color of the square, move forward one unit.

You can also view this project online in p5.js Web Editor [here](https://editor.p5js.org/torshin5ergey/full/E5ZIZMqEi) or on this project page [here](https://torshin5ergey.github.io/cellular-automata/langtons-ant/index.html).

## How to Use in Your Project

1. Clone the repository to your computer.
2. Include `p5.js` in your project.
3. Import `sketch-singlecolor.js` or `sketch-multicolor.js` into your project and use it in your code.
4. If needed, you may need to adjust the following lines in the `sketch-singlecolor.js` or `sketch-multicolor.js` file to fit your desired canvas size or container element:
```javascript
let canvas = createCanvas(windowWidth, windowHeight);
canvas.parent("canvas");
```
You can modify the dimensions passed to `createCanvas()` to adjust the size of the canvas. Additionally, you may need to change the parent element ID passed to `canvas.parent()`.
Alternatively, you can use the following line and comment out the two lines above to use a fixed canvas size:
```javascript
createCanvas(CANVAS_W, CANVAS_H);
```
Change `CANVAS_W` and `CANVAS_H` with the desired width and height of the canvas.
You also can modify number of ants in the `sketch-multicolor.js` file with `ANTS_COUNT` variable.
