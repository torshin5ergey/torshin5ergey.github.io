# Coding.exe 🎨

This is my digital generative computer graphics exhibition.
I'm exploring various techniques and tools for creating generative art. One of my favorite tools is [p5.js](https://editor.p5js.org/torshin5ergey/sketches), a JavaScript library that makes it incredibly easy to create and share visual art.
[Visit]() the digital exhibition website.

## Repository Structure

- Each project resides in its own directory.
- Each project directory contains a README.md file providing a brief description of the project and instructions.

## How to Use

1. Navigate to the directory of the project you're interested in.
2. Read the README.md file for detailed information about the project and how to use it.

## Projects

- [cellular-automata](./cellular-automata/): a collection of creative code projects based on cellular automata rules.

## GitHub Pages Deployment

Implemented an advanced deployment workflow. This is my solution to the [GitHub Pages Deployment project](https://roadmap.sh/projects/github-actions-deployment-workflow) in the [DevOps roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/devops) from [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/).

- **Lint job**
    HTML, CSS, JS lintingon every push.
- **Deployment job**
    Github Pages deployment and dependency caching.
