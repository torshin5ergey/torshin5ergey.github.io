This is my digital generative computer graphics exhibition.
I'm exploring various techniques and tools for creating generative art. One of my favorite tools is [p5.js](https://editor.p5js.org/torshin5ergey/sketches), a JavaScript library that makes it incredibly easy to create and share visual art.
